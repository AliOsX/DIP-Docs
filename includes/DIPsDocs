<h1 id="what-s-a-dip">What’s a DIP?</h1>

<p>DIPs are accessory boards that attach directly to C.H.I.P. and add extra hardware capabilities. For example, the HDMI DIP and VGA DIP both output specialized video formats that C.H.I.P. could not do without the additional DIP hardware. 
DIPs come in all sorts of flavors. &ndash; from officially Next Thing Co. DIPS like the HDMI and VGA accessory boards to community created DIPS that increase the number of USB ports on C.H.I.P. or control motors and LED matrices. [a]While any C.H.I.P.-attached hardware can be casually called a DIP, for an accessory board to be officially be called a DIP, it must adhere to the C.H.I.P. DIP Specification[b]..</p>

<h1 id="hdmi-dip">HDMI DIP</h1>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>The HDMI DIP provides the extra hardware necessary for C.H.I.P. to output video using HDMI. To connect the DIP to C.H.I.P., first orient C.H.I.P. so that the USB connector is facing away from. Then place the DIP atop C.H.I.P. with the HDMI connector facing you and gently press the two boards together.</p>

<p>Using the HDMI DIP, C.H.I.P. can output a maximum resolution of X by Y at Hz.[c]</p>

<p>The HDMI DIP makes C.H.I.P. even better for traditional uses like presentations, classrooms, and games, and makes amazing things like <a href="http://blog.nextthing.co/this-is-how-we-made-the-75-tall-mega-pocketc-h-i-p/">large-scale installations</a>, magic mirrors, and <a href="http://c-uir.org/mup/">urban projection</a>. </p>

<h1 id="vga-dip">VGA DIP</h1>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>The VGA DIP enables C.H.I.P. to output a video signal over a standard 9-pin VGA cable. To connect the DIP to C.H.I.P., first orient C.H.I.P. so that the USB connector is facing away from. Then place the DIP atop C.H.I.P. with the VGA connector facing you and gently press the two boards together[d].  </p>

<p>The VGA DIP supports higher resolutions than the on-board composite video output, with a maximum output resolution of TK by TK at TK Hz[e]. Additionally, the VGA DIP outputs resolutions in a 4:3 aspect ratio.</p>

<ul>
<li>RGB breakouts - RGB breakouts can be found at the edge of the VGA connector on the left side. These are available if you ever want to add cool effects, or to “bend” your VGA DIP</li>
<li>Trim-pot breakouts (RGB) - There are three footprints for trimpots, which can be found [here]. These can be installed with only a few solder joints, and can create a really awesome visual effects like saturating colors.
U14 breakouts - The U14 header breakout is directly to the left of U14. This is important if you would like to access FEL, UART, XIO, CSID, audio, etc. The name of each pin is labeled above the corresponding pad.</li>
<li>JST connector breakout - A JST connector footprint  is available to be populated on VGA DIP. Because the VGA connector is really close to the existing JST battery connector, it makes it difficult to plug/unplug with the VGA DIP installed. Note: DO NOT INSTALL TWO BATTERIES INTO CHIP. THIS WILL DAMAGE YOUR CHIP. </li>
<li>Prototyping area - There is “Proto board” on the PCB itself. This is convenient if you would like to add a small circuit to your VGA DIP, without having to add another board.</li>
<li>VGA connector - The VGA connector. This is a standard female DB-15 VGA connector to carry the video signal to a VGA monitor. </li>
<li>Power on switch - A Power On Switch has been added to the VGA DIP as well. It is close to impossible to access the Power On Switch on C.H.I.P with the VGA DIP installed, so we added a second Power On Switch. This is located on the right side of the PCB, and is accompanied by a “Power On” symbol. </li>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<ul>

<h2 id="use-it">Use It</h2>

<p>The VGA DIP is extremely easy to use. It’s really as simple as attaching the DIP to your CHIP, plugging in a VGA monitor, and booting up CHIP. But, for posterity’s sake, here’s all the details. </p>

<h1 id="updating-c-h-i-p-to-debian-4-4">Updating C.H.I.P. to Debian 4.4</h1>

<p>In addition to being physically attached to C.H.I.P., DIPs require that C.H.I.P. is running the Debian 4.4 Linux kernel.
Determine C.H.I.P.’s Kernel Version
To determine if you need to upgrade your C.H.I.P.’s kernel, connect a keyboard, mouse, and display to C.H.I.P., then power on the board. 
Once open the terminal application from the drop-down menu at the top, left corner of the Desktop.</p>

<p>Once the applications loads, type <code class="prettyprint">uname -a</code>. This outputs information about your system software version. 
Look for a number in appended with <code class="prettyprint">-ntc</code>, for example <code class="prettyprint">4.3.0-ntc</code> or <code class="prettyprint">4.4.0-ntc</code>. This number is the kernel version running on your C.H.I.P. If the number is <code class="prettyprint">4.4.0</code> or greater, you don’t need to upgrade your kernel version. If your number is <code class="prettyprint">4.3.0</code>, keep reading, you need to upgrade your kernel.</p>

<h2 id="back-up-c-h-i-p-s-data">Back-up C.H.I.P.’s Data</h2>

<p>Back-up any important data on your C.H.I.P. before you upgrade your system. Upgrading will overwrite all of the C.H.I.P. storage.</p>

<h2 id="upgrade-the-kernel-with-the-c-h-i-p-flasher">Upgrade the Kernel with the C.H.I.P. Flasher</h2>

<p>Using the <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/">Chrome</a> or <a href="https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium">Chromium</a> web browser, visit <a href="http://flash.getchip.com">flash.getchip.com</a> and follow the on-screen instructions. When the flasher presents you with different OS images to choose from, click on “CHIP OS 1.1” to select it.</p>

<p>When flashing is complete, follow the instructions for using your DIP.</p>
