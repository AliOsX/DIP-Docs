          <h1 id="what-s-a-dip">What’s a DIP?</h1>

<p>DIPs are accessory boards that attach directly to C.H.I.P. and add extra hardware capabilities. For example, the HDMI DIP and VGA DIP both output specialized video formats that C.H.I.P. could not do without the additional DIP hardware. 
DIPs come in all sorts of flavors. &ndash; from officially Next Thing Co. DIPS like the HDMI and VGA accessory boards to community created DIPS that increase the number of USB ports on C.H.I.P. or control motors and LED matrices. [a]While any C.H.I.P.-attached hardware can be casually called a DIP, for an accessory board to be officially be called a DIP, it must adhere to the C.H.I.P. DIP Specification.</p>

          <h1 id="hdmi-dip">HDMI DIP</h1>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>The HDMI DIP provides the extra hardware necessary for C.H.I.P. to output video using HDMI. To connect the DIP to C.H.I.P., first orient C.H.I.P. so that the USB connector is facing away from. Then place the DIP atop C.H.I.P. with the HDMI connector facing you and gently press the two boards together.</p>

<p>Using the HDMI DIP, C.H.I.P. can output a maximum resolution of 1920 by 1080 at 30Hz (a.k.a, 1080p)</p>

<p>The HDMI DIP makes C.H.I.P. even better for traditional uses like presentations, classrooms, and games, and makes amazing things like <a href="http://blog.nextthing.co/this-is-how-we-made-the-75-tall-mega-pocketc-h-i-p/">large-scale installations</a>, magic mirrors, and <a href="http://c-uir.org/mup/">urban projection</a>. </p>

<ul>
<li>Power switch: We added this is located on the top edge of the PCB, as it is close to impossible to access it. </li>
<li>Prototyping area - There is “Proto board” on the PCB itself. This is convenient if you would like to add a small circuit to your DIP, without having to add another board.</li>
<li>U14 partial breakout - This makes it easy to access the GPIO, UART, audio, and ground pins.</li>
<li>Volts - 5V &amp; 3V voltages are available below the NTC proto area. </li>
<li>HDMI connector - A standard HDMI connector is used to send your video to a monitor, and is located at the bottom of the PCB.<br></li>
<li>The Video Processor is the brains of the HDMI DIP. It takes the video from the LCD_Dx pins.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="requirements">Requirements</h2>

<ul>
<li>C.H.I.P. with C.H.I.P. OS 1.1 with Debian 4.4 kernel</li>
<li>HDMI display</li>
<li>HDMI cable</li>
</ul>

<p>If you don’t have Debian 4.4, or if you are unsure, <a href="#update_to_debian44">follow this guide</a>.</p>

<h2 id="use-it">Use It</h2>

<p><img alt="Plug it!" src="images/hdmi_plugged_in_half.jpg" /></p>

<p>The HDMI DIP is extremely easy to use. Once you have your C.H.I.P. OS updated, it’s really as simple as attaching the DIP to your C.H.I.P, plugging in an HDMI monitor, and booting up C.H.I.P. But, for posterity’s sake, here’s all the details. </p>

<ul>
<li>Connect DIP to C.H.I.P.</li>
<li>Connect cable to DIP and monitor</li>
<li>Power up C.H.I.P.</li>
</ul>

<p>Once C.H.I.P has power, you&rsquo;ll start seeing output on your monitor. Once C.H.I.P is booted, you may want to change the resolution. You can do this with the control panel found in the Computer Things menu, going to Settings/Display </p>

<p><img alt="display control panel" src="images/settings_select.jpg" /></p>

<p>In the Display control panel, you can select a resolution in the Outputs menu:</p>

<p><img alt="Change Resolutions" src="images/settings_hdmi_resolution.jpg" /></p>

<p>After you select a resolution, you&rsquo;ll need to &ldquo;Apply&rdquo; it:</p>

<p><img alt="apply the new resolution" src="images/settings_apply.jpg" /></p>

<p>If you like using commandline in the terminal, you can change resolutions with <code class="prettyprint">xrandr</code>, such as</p>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>xrandr -s 1280x720
</code></pre>

<h2 id="know-it">Know it</h2>

<h3 id="supported-resolutions">Supported Resolutions</h3>

<p>We cannot provide an exhaustive list of all resolutions, since this can depend on the attached monitor, but here are some observed resolutions:</p>

<ul>
<li>1360x768</li>
<li>1920x1080</li>
<li>1680x1050</li>
<li>1280x1024</li>
<li>1280x960</li>
<li>1280x800</li>
<li>1280x720</li>
<li>1024x768</li>
<li>800x600</li>
<li>720x480</li>
<li>640x480</li>
<li>720x400</li>
</ul>

<p>HDMI DIP only does video - it does not carry an audio signal.</p>

          <h1 id="vga-dip">VGA DIP</h1>

<h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>

<p>The VGA DIP enables C.H.I.P. to output a video signal over a standard 9-pin VGA cable. To connect the DIP to C.H.I.P., first orient C.H.I.P. so that the USB connector is facing away from. Then place the DIP atop C.H.I.P. with the VGA connector facing you and gently press the two boards together.  </p>

<p>The VGA DIP supports higher resolutions than the on-board composite video output, with a maximum output resolution of 1600 by 900 at 60 Hz. Unlike the 16:9 ratio of HDMI, the VGA DIP outputs in a 4:3 aspect ratio.</p>

<ul>
<li>RGB breakouts - RGB breakouts can be found at the edge of the VGA connector on the left side. These are available if you ever want to add cool effects, or to “bend” your VGA DIP</li>
<li>Trim-pot breakouts (RGB) - There are three footprints for1 0K trimpots. These can be installed with only a few solder joints, and can create a really awesome visual effects like saturating colors.</li>
<li>U14 breakouts - The U14 header breakout is directly to the left of U14. This is important if you would like to access FEL, UART, XIO, CSID, audio, etc. The name of each pin is labeled above the corresponding pad.</li>
<li>JST connector breakout - A JST connector footprint  is available to be populated on VGA DIP. Because the VGA connector is really close to the existing JST battery connector, it makes it difficult to plug/unplug with the VGA DIP installed. Note: DO NOT INSTALL TWO BATTERIES INTO C.H.I.P. THIS WILL DAMAGE YOUR C.H.I.P. </li>
<li>Prototyping area - There is “Proto board” on the PCB itself. This is convenient if you would like to add a small circuit to your VGA DIP, without having to add another board.</li>
<li>VGA connector - This is a standard female DB-15 VGA connector to carry the video signal to a VGA monitor. </li>
<li>Power switch - A Power switch has been added to the VGA DIP. It is close to impossible to access the Power On Switch on C.H.I.P with the VGA DIP installed, so we added a second Power On Switch. This is located on the right side of the PCB, and is accompanied by a “Power On” symbol. </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-to-disconnect-the-dip">How to disconnect the DIP</h3>

<p>With great care! It&rsquo;s important to pull with an even force to separate the DIP from the CHIP. You do not want bent header pins on your DIP! We&rsquo;ve found that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IC_extractor">IC Extractor</a> is an excellent companion if you want to frequently remove DIPs.</p>

<h2 id="hack-it">Hack It</h2>

<p>Heat up your soldering iron, the VGA DIP is hackable. You may have noticed the pads suitably spaced for 10K trim pots, and the RGB breakouts. Here&rsquo;s a photo guide to soldering up some trim pots so you can manually adjust the individual red, green, and blue levels in the image.</p>

Can I use the composite video at the same time?</p>

          <h1 id="update-c-h-i-p-to-debian-4-4">Update C.H.I.P to Debian 4.4</h1>

<p>DIPs require that C.H.I.P. is running the Debian 4.4 Linux kernel. Here&rsquo;s a detailed guide to determining if you need to update and how to update using our web flasher.</p>

<h2 id="determine-c-h-i-p-s-kernel-version">Determine C.H.I.P.’s Kernel Version</h2>

<p>To determine if you need to upgrade your C.H.I.P.’s kernel, connect a keyboard, mouse, and display to C.H.I.P., then power up CHIP.
Then, open the Terminal application (from the drop-down menu at the top, left corner of the Desktop.</p>

<p>Once the applications loads, type <code class="prettyprint">uname -a</code>. This outputs information about your system software version.</p>

<p><img alt="uname results in terminal" src="images/update_uname.jpg" /></p>

<p>Look for a number in appended with <code class="prettyprint">-ntc</code>, for example <code class="prettyprint">4.3.0-ntc</code> or <code class="prettyprint">4.4.0-ntc</code>. This number is the kernel version running on your C.H.I.P. If the number is <code class="prettyprint">4.4.0</code> or greater, you don’t need to upgrade your kernel version. Most likely, your number is <code class="prettyprint">4.3.0</code>, keep reading, you need to upgrade your kernel.</p>

<h2 id="back-up-c-h-i-p-s-data">Back-up C.H.I.P.’s Data</h2>

<p>Backup any important data on your C.H.I.P. before you upgrade your system. Upgrading will overwrite all of the C.H.I.P. storage. You can backup your user directory with a simple command in the Terminal emulator:</p>
<pre class="highlight shell"><code>tar cfpz homebackup.tar.gz /home/chip
</code></pre>

<p>You can transfer that <code class="prettyprint">tar</code> file to another computer or cloud service from C.H.I.P. There&rsquo;s more to learn in <a href="https://mylinuxramblings.wordpress.com/2010/01/10/how-to-backup-and-restore-your-home-directory/">this detailed guide</a>.</p>

<p>If you have installed a lot of packages with Synaptic or <code class="prettyprint">apt</code>, and would like to be able to be able to easily re-install those packages, there&rsquo;s some good <a href="http://www.debianadmin.com/clone-your-ubuntu-installation.html">guides</a> and <a href="http://serverfault.com/questions/175504/how-do-i-get-the-history-of-apt-get-install-on-ubuntu">suggestions</a> on the web.</p>

<h2 id="upgrade-the-kernel-with-the-c-h-i-p-flasher">Upgrade the Kernel with the C.H.I.P. Flasher</h2>

<p>Using the <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/">Chrome</a> or <a href="https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium">Chromium</a> web browser, visit <a href="http://flash.getchip.com">flash.getchip.com</a> and follow the on-screen instructions. When the flasher presents you with different OS images to choose from, click on “CHIP OS 1.1” to select it.</p>

<p>When flashing is complete, follow the instructions for using your DIP.</p>
