# What’s a DIP?

DIPs are accessory boards that give new capabilities to C.H.I.P.  DIPs come in many flavors, like official Next Thing Co. HDMI and VGA DIPs that give C.H.I.P. higher resolution video output to community DIPs that add more USB ports, control motors, or blink LEDs.  C.H.I.P.s (with the proper software) automatically recognize when a DIP is attached and act accordingly.  

Here you’ll find specs and instructions for the official Next Thing Co. HDMI and VGA DIPs as well as tips and tricks to get you started making your own.

## Requirements

To properly recognize official NTC DIPs, C.H.I.P.s will need to updated to at least Debian 4.4.  For a quick start on how to update your C.H.I.P., head to getchip.com/update.  Full documentation exists in the ‘Update C.H.I.P. to Debian 4.4’ at the bottom of the page.
